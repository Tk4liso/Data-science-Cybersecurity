# Data-science-Cybersecurity
Work carried out in a summer course on cybersecurity focused on data science (e.g., machine learning models and data mining techniques, among others).

Activity 17 was my favorite because we were only given the dataset without specific instructions on what to do, meaning we were given “free rein.” Furthermore, even though the model I submitted in the report was not the final one (because I ran out of time due to long waiting times), I continued to refine the model on my own until I achieved a good result. The work in this course was extracurricular, so I saw these assignments as an introduction to Python for me and did not worry so much about making models or results as refined as possible.
